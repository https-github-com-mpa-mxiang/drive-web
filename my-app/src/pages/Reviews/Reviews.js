      'I had an amazing experience driving with Max! He is incredibly patient, funny, and kind, and I felt very comfortable driving with him. He is also very flexible and went out of his way to accommodate my difficult schedule, which was greatly appreciated. I felt so much more confident after our lessons, and I passed the G test on my first try. Highly recommend taking driving lessons with him!',

      'My son  was very happy with Maxâ€™s patience throughout the course. Max alleviated any anxiety he felt on the day of the actual driving test by familiarizing him with the test area already days before and picking him up 2 hours prior to the test for driving practice. All areas from road driving to parallel parking were covered. My son was successful On his first try! Thanks Max!',
